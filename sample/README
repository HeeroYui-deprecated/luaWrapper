This repository is a very simple example of how you can use LuaWrapper to
create typesafe bindings between Lua and C++. This is not a complete tutorial,
but rather just a quick project to illustrate how the library is used.
Specifically, it does not cover the hold, release or clean functions. 

See the README functions in ./example1/ and ./example2/ for more information.

The main repository for LuaWrapper can be found at
