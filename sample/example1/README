This folder includes a simple project to demonstrate how LuaWrapper may be used
to bind your C++ class to Lua. 

main.cpp contains a simple main function that will call luaopen_BankAccount
then run the script given. 

BankAccount.cpp and BankAccount.hpp contain a simple BankAccount class which you 
can use to deposit and withdraw money from, and check the current balance. 

LuaBankAccount.cpp contains the function wrappers. This is where the interesting
part is.

A visual studio project and makefile are provided, or you can use your own 
tool chain to compile the example. Once compiled, run 

    example1.exe example1.lua

    or 

    ./example1 example1.lua

to see the code in action.
